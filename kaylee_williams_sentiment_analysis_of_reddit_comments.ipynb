        "## Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "In the last five years, mainstream news outlets have published hundreds of news articles on the supposed dangers of “deepfake technology”—that is, machine learning tools that enable the user to digitally manipulate video footage [(Roose, 2018)](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/04/technology/fake-videos-deepfakes.html). Studies show that the majority of that coverage has focussed on potential adverse impacts to the political arena, as well as to the public's trust in democratic institutions [(Goose and Burkell, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/15295036.2020.1832697).\n",
        "\n",
        "As a result, much of the mainstream coverage of deepfake technology has failed to acknowledge that the vast majority of deepfake videos currently available online—96 percent, according to some estimates[(Ajder et al. 2019)](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://regmedia.co.uk/2019/10/08/deepfake_report.pdf)—are actually pornographic in nature, not political.\n",
        "\n",
        "The truth about deepfakes that mainstream news coverage often fails to disclose is that the deep-learning technology behind the uncanny videos was first developed in 2017 on Reddit, where a group of several thousand AI-enthusiasts collaborated to create sexually-explicit, realistic-looking videos of female celebrities, as well as their friends, classmates, and acquaintances, without their knowledge or consent [(Cole 2017)](https://www.vice.com/en/article/gydydm/gal-gadot-fake-ai-porn).\n",
        "\n",
        "In the years since, sexually-explicit deepfakes (or \"deepfake pornography\") have continued to proliferate online, often forcing unsuspecting victims into humiliating or otherwise compromising videos for the entertainment and sexual gratification of others [(Flynn et al., 2021)](https://academic.oup.com/bjc/article/62/6/1341/6448791).\n",
        "\n",
        "Today, the sharing of deepfake pornography is officially banned on Reddit, but the supposed  value of the tech, as well as it's privacy risks and potential criminalization, remain frequent topics of debate on the platform [(Robertson, 2018)](https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/7/16982046/reddit-deepfakes-ai-celebrity-face-swap-porn-community-ban).\n",
        "\n",
        "For this reason, many Reddit users are both familiar with the ethical concerns associated with deepfake pornography, and have engaged in in-depth discussions surrounding its risks and affordances on the site. Additionally, the technological affordances of Reddit (such as the ability to post anonymously, and the lack of a character limit for original posts and comments) make it one of the best available sources for public data that researchers can analyse in an effort to approximate the wider public's perception of this emerging phenonema [(Proferes et al. 2021)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/20563051211019004)\n",
        ".\n",
        "\n",
        "In an effort to do just that, I've conducted a sentiment analysis of more than 8,600 individual Reddit user comments, posted across 76 separate posts related to deepfake pornography within three popular subreddits (r/technology, r/AskReddit, and r/TwoXChromosomes), in an effort to learn whether Reddit users in each of these forums have an overall positive, negative, or neutral perception of deepfake pornography."

        "## Hypotheses & Subreddit Selection\n",
        "\n",
        "The subreddits of interest in this study were selected for their relative popularity on the overall platform, and because each one regularly plays host to in-depth debates about the ethics and presumed values of deepfake pornography. Furthermore, each subreddit represents a different sub-community of Reddit users whose perceptions of deepfake pornography are expected to represent a range of views on this issue.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, [r/technology](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/) (15.2 million subscribers) represents a community of users interested in “news and discussions about the creation and use of technology and its surrounding issues.” Users in this community tend to share a largely positive (arguably even utopian) view of technology, and a largely negative view of government intervention or regulation in the world of technological advancement. From an anecdotal perspective, in previous research observing this subreddit, I have observed many users arguing that deepfake pornography should be legally protected under the First Amendment, because it is, according to them, a form of technologically-assisted self expression, similar to a painting of a nude subject.\n",
        "\n",
        "**H1: Having observed these pro-deepfake arguments being presented on r/technology, I hypothesize that the sentiment analysis will reveal that this subreddit plays host to a relatively positive view of deepfake pornography.**\n",
        "\n",
        "With more than 43 million subscribers, [r/AskReddit](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r26ocEjvVkK4gBZAJMFRm6uKK3cWSZy8#scrollTo=QcvH8CbivpkX&line=17&uniqifier=1) is one of the most popular forums on the platform, and represents a general audience of users, who regularly pose open questions (such as \"What is deepfake pornography?\") to their fellow Reddit users, which often result in in-depth conversation and debates on complicated or controversial social issues. Key term searches for posts related to \"deepfake pornography\" within the r/AskReddit reveal that a significant portion of the posts related to this topic are largely informational, rather than persuasive or ideologically charged.\n",
        "\n",
        "**H2: For these reasons, I hypothesize that r/AskReddit users will, on average, have a relatively neutral view or perception of pornographic deepfakes.**\n",
        "\n",
        "Lastly, [r/TwoXChromosomes](https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/) (13.6 million subscribers) is a forum dedicated to hosting “women's perspectives” on a variety of topics, including individual experiences of sexual abuse and harassment, both online and off. Speaking generally, users on this subreddit tend to share a feminist ideological bend, and most often discuss deepfake pornography from the perspective of a \"potential victims,\" meaning that they often express concern about their own personal risks of being targetted for this kind of abuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "**H3: As such, I hypothesize that r/TwoXChromosomes users will, on average, express the most negative perceptions of deepfake pornography, when compared to users of r/technology and r/AskReddit.**\n",
        "\n",
        "**H4: Overall, I hypothesize that Reddit users across these three subreddits will be very split in terms of their perceptions of pornographic deepfakes, with each group holding either a strongly positive or strongly negative perception of the topic.**"

        "According to the [documentation](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment#about-the-scoring) provided by the creators of the vaderSentiment calculator, \"compound\" sentiment scores are \"computed by summing the valence scores of each word in the lexicon, adjusted according to the rules, and then normalized to be between -1 (most extreme negative) and +1 (most extreme positive).\"\n",

        "Knowing this, the mean scores for each of the subreddits reveal that overall, Reddit users have a surprisingly neutral overall perception of deepfake pornography. Across all three forums, none of the average sentiment scores reached 0.1 in either the positive or negative direction, suggesting that the topic is discussed relatively nuetrally by users within these three digital commuties. This more or less completely disproves H4, by showing that, at least in the aggregate, Reddit users in these three forums agree more than they disagree with regards to this specific, ethically-contentious issue.\n",

This finding wholly disproves H1, which suggested that the overall sentiment would be positive.\n",

        "In fact, r/AskReddit had the most positive mean sentiment score among the three forums: 0.01. However, given this score's proximity to zero, it is more accurate to say it this reflects an extremely neutral perception of deepfake pornography on r/AskReddit, rather than a positive one. This finding supports H2.\n",

However, this score is only slightly more negative than that of the other two forums, which was surprising."

The porno wasn't even good. Did you know the porn stars ask me for advice in bed? It's true. They say, \"Donald, how do you do it? I hear you are just the best.
