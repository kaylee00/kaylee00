### Hello world <3

- My name is Kaylee (she/her).
- I'm a PhD student at the Columbia Journalism School.
- I study political communication and media effects, particularly related to social media and journalism.
- I use R for performing statistical analysis, mostly of public opinion data. 
- I'm currently learning to use Python for web scraping and text analysis.
- If you see nonsensical code on my portfolio, it's because I'm a n00b and I'm using a lot of training datasets ðŸ˜„
