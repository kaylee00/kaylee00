### Hello world,

My name is Kaylee (she/her), and I'm a PhD student at the Columbia Journalism School. 

Broadly speaking, I study political communication, public opinion, and media effects.

I'm in the process of learning the fundamentals of Python for web scraping and text analysis so that I can analyze large numbers of news articles and social media posts, particularly on Instagram. I'm a coding n00b, but very excited to incorporate data science into my dissertation.
